  "notes": "Droid's single comment was a false positive - it flagged a hypothetical issue about create_issue_occurrence_from_result being called with None, but the code already has a guard (if result.result is not None) in the only caller. Droid missed the actual critical bug: MetricAlertDetectorHandler inherits from StatefulDetectorHandler without implementing any of the 4 required abstract methods."
