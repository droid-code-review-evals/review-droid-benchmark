  "validation_notes": "Both droid and golden identified the same 2 bugs in this PR. Droid comments were more specific with file paths and line numbers, while golden comments described the issues clearly but lacked location details. The bugs are: (1) dayjs object comparison using === which always returns false, creating dead code for all-day override detection, and (2) copy-paste error where 'end' variable uses slotStartTime instead of slotEndTime, allowing bookings to extend past working hours."
