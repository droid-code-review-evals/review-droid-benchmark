  "validation_notes": "Droid outperformed golden on this PR. All 5 droid comments were valid bugs with specific file:line references. Droid identified the critical P0 bug in getCalendarCredentials where getCalendar() was changed to async but the function still stores the result without await, causing a type mismatch (Promise<Calendar> stored where Calendar expected). Golden correctly identified the forEach(async...) pattern but as a single generic comment covering 4 instances, and had 1 false positive about adding try-catch for import failures that already have graceful handling."
