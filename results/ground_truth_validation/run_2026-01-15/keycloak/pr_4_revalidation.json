      "notes": "Re-verified on pr-4: the call is to the Keycloak Picocli wrapper instance (field `picocli` from AbstractCommand), whose `exit(int)` only calls System.exit for non-OK codes when not running in test launch mode (see quarkus/runtime/.../Picocli.java:203-207). For CLI usage, exiting with the command's exit code is intended behavior; 'embedded usage' is not a supported requirement for these commands."
