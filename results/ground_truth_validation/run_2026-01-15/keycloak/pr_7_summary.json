  "notes": "Droid focused on the Java sanitizer logic but produced 2 false positives. The first claimed _en.properties files would look for _en_en.properties which is incorrect (regex replaces entire suffix). The second claimed wrong variable in replaceFirst but the equality check ensures both strings match. Golden correctly identified localization bugs (wrong language/character set) and a typo but also had one false positive about anchor validation logic."
