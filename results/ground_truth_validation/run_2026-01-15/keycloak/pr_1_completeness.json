  "analysis_notes": "All 3 droid comments were false positives about potential NPE when webauthnAuth is null, but they failed to read the isConditionalPasskeysEnabled() method which already checks webauthnAuth != null. The droid completely missed the actual behavioral regression - that conditional passkey UI is no longer set up for initial login (when user is null), breaking ID-less passkey authentication. One golden comment (the detailed one) correctly identified this regression."
