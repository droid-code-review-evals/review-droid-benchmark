    "ground_truth_explanation": "This PR adds a lightweight AuthzClientCryptoProvider for the authz-client module. The only confirmed bug is dead code in the ECDSA signature encoding method where two ASN1Encoder instances are created and discarded without use.",
    "droid_false_positive_analysis": "Droid had 2 false positives: (1) Claimed KeyStore.getInstance needs NoSuchAlgorithmException handling, which is incorrect - the JCA method only throws KeyStoreException. (2) Claimed repeated CryptoIntegration.init() calls are problematic, but the init() method already uses double-checked locking.",
    "golden_false_positive_analysis": "Golden had 1 false positive: Claimed getBouncyCastleProvider returns 'wrong' provider. However, this is intentional design - WildFlyElytronProvider returns null for the same method, and the fallback behavior handles non-BC providers gracefully. This is a lightweight client provider where BC may not be available."
