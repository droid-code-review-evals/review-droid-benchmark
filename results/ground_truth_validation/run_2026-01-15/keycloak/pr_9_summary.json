  "notes": "Both droid and golden achieved identical precision (1.0) and recall (0.667). They found different bugs in addition to the shared Optional.get() issue. Droid caught the more severe NPE bug (high severity runtime error), while golden caught a lower-severity logic bug about missing credential id. The golden comment about Optional.get() also mentions 'unsafe raw List deserialization' which refers to a separate minor concern in BackwardsCompatibilityUserStorage, but the main bug description is accurate."
