  "summary": "Both droid and golden achieved perfect precision and recall. The PR introduces a race condition by moving the cacheMu lock in BuildIndex from protecting the entire function to only the cache assignment. This creates two related bugs: (1) concurrent BuildIndex calls can race on map writes, and (2) TotalDocs() iterates the cache map without any lock and races with concurrent BuildIndex writes. The droid caught both issues in a single well-written comment. Golden split this into two separate comments. Both correctly identified the root cause and potential for 'fatal error: concurrent map read/write' panics."
