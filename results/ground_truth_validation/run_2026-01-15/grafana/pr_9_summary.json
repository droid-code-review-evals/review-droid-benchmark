  "notes": "Both droid and golden identified the same 2 critical bugs in this PR: (1) the enableSqlExpressions function that always returns false regardless of feature flag state, and (2) the stub DB implementation that replaces the working go-duck library with methods that return 'not implemented'. Droid provided more specific details about the inverted flag logic and the replacement of go-duck, while golden comments were slightly more concise."
