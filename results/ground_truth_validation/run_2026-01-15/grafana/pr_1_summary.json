  "notes": "Bug #2 (auth failure on device limit) and the design implications appear intentional based on PR title 'Add configurable device limit'. Both droid and golden flagged it as a concern, which is valid from a resilience perspective. The golden had 2 false positives: (1) the Exec compilation claim is incorrect (pattern already used in codebase), (2) the time window inconsistency concern is not a real issue."
