      "reasoning": "This is a misleading test comment, not a functional bug. The test's intent is to prove permDenialCache takes precedence over permCache. Since permDenialCache is checked first and returns denial immediately, the permCache is never reached - whether it stores true or false is irrelevant to the test outcome. The test logic is correct; only the explanatory comment is confusing."
