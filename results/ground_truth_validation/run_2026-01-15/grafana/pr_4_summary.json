  "notes": "This PR is a refactoring to move template variable interpolation earlier in the query splitting process. The change moves the call from interpolateVariablesInQueries (batch) to applyTemplateVariables (per-query) at the start of both runSplitQuery and runShardSplitQuery. The golden comment incorrectly flags the lack of filters in test setup as a bug - it's actually just a test coverage observation. The filters parameter is optional, and there are existing tests for adhocFilters functionality in datasource.test.ts. No actual bugs were found in this PR."
