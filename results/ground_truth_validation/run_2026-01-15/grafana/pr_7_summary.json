  "summary": "This PR modifies the annotation cleanup logic to split queries and deletes to avoid MySQL deadlocks. Droid found 2 valid issues: (1) Error log level used for debugging info which will flood production logs and leak internal IDs, and (2) the cleanup ticker was changed from 10 minutes to 1 minute, increasing DB load 10x - this appears to be test/debug code accidentally committed. Golden found only the logging issue (1/2 bugs). Droid achieved perfect precision and recall (1.0), while Golden achieved perfect precision but only 50% recall (0.667 F1)."
