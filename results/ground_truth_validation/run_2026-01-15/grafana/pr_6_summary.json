  "analysis_notes": "All 5 droid comments were valid bugs. Golden had 3 comments covering 4 of the 5 bugs (one golden comment was vague enough to cover both Create and Update recordLegacyDuration bugs). Droid found one bug that golden missed: the DeleteCollection goroutine incorrectly using recordStorageDuration for a legacy operation. Droid showed higher precision and recall, with more specific file/line details."
