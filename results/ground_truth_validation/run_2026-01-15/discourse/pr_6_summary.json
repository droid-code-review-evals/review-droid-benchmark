  "summary": "PR #6 adds server-side website_name computation for user profiles. Ground truth contains 3 bugs: (1) missing ? suffix on include_website_name method (high severity, caught by both), (2) string literal mutation with << operator (medium, golden only), (3) flawed domain comparison logic using label count (medium, droid only). Droid had 2 false positives (nil hostname concern and query string preservation). Golden comment was high quality - covered 2 bugs clearly with good specificity."
