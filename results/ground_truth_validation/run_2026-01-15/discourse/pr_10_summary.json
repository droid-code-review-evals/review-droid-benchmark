  "notes": "Interesting case where droid and golden found completely disjoint sets of bugs with no overlap. Both achieved 100% precision (no false positives) but only 50% recall each. Droid focused on migration issues and test infrastructure, while golden focused on model/controller runtime errors and data consistency issues."
