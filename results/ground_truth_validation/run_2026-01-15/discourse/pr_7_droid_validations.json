      "reasoning": "Verified by examining the diff: original was `color: scale-color($primary, $lightness: 30%)`, now changed to `dark-light-choose(scale-color($primary, $lightness: 70%), scale-color($secondary, $lightness: 30%))`. The light theme value went from 30% to 70% - a dramatic inversion that makes text much lighter and harder to read.",
