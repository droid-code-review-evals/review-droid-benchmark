  "notes": "Both droid comments were false positives due to misreading the code structure. Comment 1 incorrectly claimed ensure_loaded! was defined at module Backend level when it's actually in I18n's singleton class. Comment 2 incorrectly conflated client-side JavaScript I18n.fallbacks=false with server-side Ruby, not understanding that Rails initializers always run before controller actions. The golden comments correctly identified two real (but low-severity) issues: thread-safety in lazy initialization and String/Symbol type normalization."
