  "summary": "Droid performed poorly on this PR with 0% precision and recall. Both droid comments were false positives stemming from misunderstanding Ruby code structure and Rails initialization order. The golden comments correctly identified two real low-severity bugs: a thread-safety race condition in lazy initialization and a String/Symbol normalization issue. This PR had subtle concurrency and type-consistency issues that require deeper understanding of Ruby semantics."
