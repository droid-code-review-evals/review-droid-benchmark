  "notes": "Droid had one false positive claiming -webkit-inline-box is invalid, when it's actually a supported legacy value. Droid missed the more subtle layout regression where removing float:right from .panel breaks the noscript header (where .panel is nested inside .row and not a direct flex child). Golden correctly identified both issues."
