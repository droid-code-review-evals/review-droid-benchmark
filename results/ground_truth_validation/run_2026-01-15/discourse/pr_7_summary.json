  "notes": "The PR modifies many SCSS files to add dark-light-choose() wrappers for dark theme support. Both droid and golden correctly identified that some changes inadvertently altered light theme values. Golden had one false positive where it claimed a 70%->30% change that actually went the opposite direction. Droid was precise but missed the user.scss .name changes. Golden caught the user.scss issue but missed the mobile modal inconsistency."
