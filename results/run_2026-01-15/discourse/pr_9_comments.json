When called as `I18n.ensure_loaded!(l)` (via `FallbackLocaleList#ensure_loaded!`), this will raise (no `load_locale` method / wrong receiver), breaking locale loading at runtime.","created_at":"2026-01-16T19:43:28Z","updated_at":"2026-01-16T19:43:28Z","html_url":"https://github.com/droid-code-review-evals/droid-discourse/pull/9#discussion_r2699756138","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/droid-code-review-evals/droid-discourse/pulls/9","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/droid-code-review-evals/droid-discourse/pulls/comments/2699756138"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/droid-code-review-evals/droid-discourse/pull/9#discussion_r2699756138"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/droid-code-review-evals/droid-discourse/pulls/9"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/droid-code-review-evals/droid-discourse/pulls/comments/2699756138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":62,"original_line":62,"side":"RIGHT","author_association":"NONE","original_position":4,"position":4,"subject_type":"line"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/droid-code-review-evals/droid-discourse/pulls/comments/2699756325","pull_request_review_id":3672453823,"id":2699756325,"node_id":"PRRC_kwDOQ4pSzs6g6wMl","diff_hunk":"@@ -155,6 +155,8 @@ def set_locale\n                   else\n                     SiteSetting.default_locale\n                   end\n+\n+    I18n.fallbacks.ensure_loaded!","path":"app/controllers/application_controller.rb","commit_id":"ecfa17b5a79dfdc91e7a4d50b42ae78a35d0a293","original_commit_id":"ecfa17b5a79dfdc91e7a4d50b42ae78a35d0a293","user":{"login":"factory-droid[bot]","id":138933559,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOCEf1Nw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/358017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/factory-droid%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/factory-droid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/factory-droid%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/factory-droid%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/factory-droid%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/factory-droid%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/factory-droid%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/factory-droid%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/factory-droid%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/factory-droid%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/factory-droid%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"body":"**[P0] Avoid calling `ensure_loaded!` on non-boolean `I18n.fallbacks`**\n\nPreviously `I18n.fallbacks` is `false` on the client and may be unset/boolean in some server contexts; this PR sets it to a custom object, but if initializers don’t run or fallbacks are disabled, `I18n.fallbacks.ensure_loaded!` will raise `NoMethodError`.
