This is reachable because `process_detectors` calls this helper for any `result` where `result.result is not None`, but other callers may not (and `DetectorEvaluationResult.result` is still optional); add an explicit `if result.result is None: return`/guard in the helper to prevent malformed events.","created_at":"2026-01-15T21:21:02Z","updated_at":"2026-01-15T21:21:02Z","html_url":"https://github.com/droid-code-review-evals/droid-sentry/pull/15#discussion_r2696001806","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/droid-code-review-evals/droid-sentry/pulls/15","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/droid-code-review-evals/droid-sentry/pulls/comments/2696001806"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/droid-code-review-evals/droid-sentry/pull/15#discussion_r2696001806"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/droid-code-review-evals/droid-sentry/pulls/15"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/droid-code-review-evals/droid-sentry/pulls/comments/2696001806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":62,"original_line":62,"side":"RIGHT","author_association":"NONE","original_position":37,"position":37,"subject_type":"line"}]
